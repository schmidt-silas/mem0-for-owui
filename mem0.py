"""
This file provides a basic structure for integrating mem0 with Open WebUI.
To make this fully functional, you would need to:
1.  Install the `mem0`, `qdrant-client`, and `ollama` Python libraries.
2.  Have Qdrant and Ollama services running and accessible.
3.  Flesh out the `initialize_clients` method with your actual connection details.
4.  Implement the logic for how mem0 should process messages. The `Mem0Filter` class
    provides a conceptual example of how you might intercept and modify messages.
    This would likely need to be implemented as a separate Filter Function that
    communicates with this Action Function.
5.  Refer to the Open WebUI documentation for the specifics of creating and
    installing custom functions.
